# Hardening Check: 006 Platform EDA Rebuild

**Feature**: Platform EDA Rebuild — Event-Driven Automation  
**Original date**: 2026-06-09  
**Retested**: 2026-07-15  

> **Retest note**: Event Forwarder is **retired** (`eventForwarder.enabled: false`). Rows 1–12 below are historical for the chart still in-tree. Live path = operator → Kafka (`amq_publish.yml`) → EDA `ansible.eda.kafka` activations. See [operators-events.md](operators-events.md) and [aap-split.md](aap-split.md).

**Scope (live)**: AMQ Streams, Decision Environments, EDA controller on central, dashboard refresh

## NIST Control Mapping (Summary)

| NIST Family | Control Area | How Addressed |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| AC | Access Control | Least-privilege RBAC on forwarder; user-token-only dashboard mutations |
| AU | Audit | K8s Events retained; forwarder logs event UID + reason (no token leakage) |
| CM | Configuration Management | All components deployed via ArgoCD GitOps |
| IA | Identification & Authentication | Event Stream bearer token; EDA admin token from Vault |
| SC | System & Communications Protection | TLS to Event Stream; NetworkPolicy gap tracked (#4) |
| SI | System Integrity | Image provenance via Red Hat base images; private registry |

## Deviations from Best Practice

| Deviation | Why | Where | Remediation / Production Target |
|-----------|-----|-------|----------------------------------|
| Custom event forwarder (non-Red Hat product) | RHACM does not forward `events.k8s.io/v1`; no supported central→services K8s watch | `eda/event-forwarder/` | Evaluate Red Hat supported alternatives when available; maintain forwarder with security review cadence |
| Cross-cluster status writes | EDA on central must update CR status on services | `eda/*/roles/*_provision/`, `*_teardown/` | Acceptable deviation; token scoped via ArgoCD cluster registration |
| No NetworkPolicy on forwarder | Initial chart focused on functional delivery | `bootstrap/helm/charts/event-forwarder/` | Add egress-only NetworkPolicy restricting to Event Stream host + kube-apiserver |
| `validate_certs: false` on cross-cluster API | ArgoCD cluster secret may not include CA bundle | EDA provision/teardown roles | Enable cert validation when CA is stored alongside bearer token |
